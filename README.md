GlowCare - Simple Website 

What is it?
GlowCare is a basic front-end e-commerce website for beauty products. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as an internship project. 


Key Features

Product Display: Shows various beauty and skincare products. 
Search Bar: Helps you find products by typing in keywords. 
Add to Cart: Allows adding items to a shopping cart. 
Buy Now: A quick way to purchase a single item. 

How to Run It

Save the website's HTML files (e.g., index.html and search-results.html) in the same folder.
Open index.html (or your main website file) in any web browser.

Important Notes

This is a front-end only website. It doesn't have a database or server. 
Product data is built into the code. 
Cart and purchase actions are simulated (they don't process real payments or save data).
